# GIPHY
 
Uses GIPHY api to retrieve images.
10 images are pulled, and then replaced on button clicks. A version is available wherein additional buttons are prepended and do not overwrite existing images.

Title and rating are additionally pulled. A download function is available, though it seems to have some issues in chrome due to settings from the browser. Other browsers should be able to use the download functionality.

A user can request gifs relating to other topics by creating a button, which is appended to the button list, and then they may click on that to retrieve gifs related to the keyword.

Possible improvements include changing the code so that the images are randomized, as well as the option to click the same button and retrieve an additional 10 images that are either offset/randomized.
